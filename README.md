## How do I use it?
Put the ```smoketags``` folder inside ```/addons/default/widgets/``` 
or ```/addons/shared_addons/widgets/```. From there, go into your 
PyroCMS admin panel and enable it via the content-> widgets. From 
there, you can configure it to your liking. It's also based heavily 
off [tagcanvas](http://www.goat1000.com/tagcanvas-options.php#jquery) 
and jQuery, so it isn't too difficult to go into the
```views/display.php``` in the widget folder and modify the 
the parameters manually, if the configuration form alone doesn't suit
your needs.
